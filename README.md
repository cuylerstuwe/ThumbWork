# Paradigm

Review platforms work best when they are:

- Simple
- Exclusive
- Reciprocitive
- Current

# Methodology

## Simplicity

*Most other mTurk review platforms operate on a 5-star review platform with 4+ criteria.*

To reduce the amount of time it takes to complete or read a review, ThumbWork will reduce this to 1 simple criteria, with two possible options:

- üëç
- üëé

*Other platforms also encourage some users to wax poetic on their soapbox, writing an entire essay about how they were wronged.*

ThumbWork will allow only 80 characters per review, encouraging reviews that are easy to skim, and making these reviews easy to embed in various locations.

## Exclusivity

*People have wildly different expectations, and the differences between people make most feedback useless to most other people.*

ThumbWork will operate on a *"friends"* paradigm: People will only see the reviews of people they are *"friends"* with.

## Reciprocitive

*[It's easier for small groups to enforce reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number), keeping the entire group more efficient as a whole by ensuring that nobody leeches off the hard work of only a few.*

ThumbWork's *"small group"* approach should help ensure that no member is dead weight.

## Current

*Information loses value as it ages.*

Reviews on ThumbWork will last a maximum of 24 hours, in order to better highlight recent information.
